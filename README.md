- 👋 Hi, I’m Deniz Duran
- 👀 I’m interested in Radio Frequency Designs such as miniaturized array antennas, RF Power Ampplifiers, Multiplexers; basically all components which put together the RF transceiver chain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to enhance my understanding of RF system/block level specifications along with embedded development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any RF related projects and gaining experience with lab equipment such as Spectrum Analyzer, Digitizers, High Speed Serial Data analyzers, JTAG debuggers, etc.
